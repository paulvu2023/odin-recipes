    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Vegetables - green onions, carrots, corn, and peas.</li>
        <li>Seasonings - fresh ginger, rice cooking wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Round Dumpling Wrappers</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil and Water</li>
        <li>Black Sesame Seeds - for garnish</li>
        <li>Green Onions - for garnish</li>
        <li>Vinegar Dipping Sauce - black vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Make the Filling:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add ground beef, green onions, ginger, cooking wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, sugar and salt. Stir with a spatula until evenly combined. Add carrots, corn and peas until evenly mixed.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic cling wrap and marinate for at least one hour in the refrigerator to soak in all the flavours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Wrap the Dumplings:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a small bowl of water for dipping your fingers into. Take one dumpling wrapper at a time and place it in your palm. Dip your finger into water and smear it along the edge of the wrapper.</li>
        <li>Transfer a tablespoon of filling into the centre. Fold the wrapper over into a half-moon shape, and enclose the filling inside. Press the edges together to seal, or pleat the edges together with your finger. Place the dumpling on a parchment-lined baking tray.</li>
        <li>Repeat with all dumplings. Cover with a tea towel to prevent the wrappers from drying out.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pan-Fry the Dumplings:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large non-stick frying pan until hot, about 3 minutes. Place a batch of 12-15 dumplings on the pan and place them approximately ½-inch apart to make sure that they don't stick together. Cook for 3 minutes until the bottom turns golden brown. (To get all sides crispy rather than just the bottom like we did, then cook on both sides until golden and crispy).</li>
        <li>Add water into the pan to cover half of the dumplings' height (½-inch deep). The water should start sizzling and boiling immediately. Cover with the lid and cook for 7-8 minutes until almost all the water has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and lower the temperature to medium heat. Cook for another 2 minutes until all water has been absorbed. The bottom of the dumplings should be crispy.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Serve:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, make the vinegar dipping sauce by combining black vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil and green onions. You can also add some Sriracha for a spicy kick.</li>
        <li>Transfer the crispy dumplings onto a plate and sprinkle some black sesame seeds and green onions on top. Serve with a side of homemade vinegar dipping sauce or spicy chili oil.</li>
    </ol>
